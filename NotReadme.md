# Our Process

## 1. [Preprocess](#1-preprocess)
we begun by discussing what is the best way to preprocess our data. We decided to use the following steps:
1. Group by chapter to create data for whole chapters (currently divided aribtrarely)
2. Break down data to sentences, which will make it easier to later identify connections between characters

## 2. [Character Definition](#2-character-definition)
Since we want to identify relationships between characters, we will have to define what (or who) a character is. We decided to use outside data (from [Harry Potter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset/data) on kaggle) as well as our own book knowledge (we are our own domain experts!) to define characters.

## 3. [Network Creation](#3-network-creation)
